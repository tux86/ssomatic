### Features

* distribute as a CLI-only npm package ([5307746](https://github.com/tux86/awssesh/commit/5307746d89817027319176b4da3fd7a60f6599c7))

### Refactoring

* **aws:** replace Bun APIs with node:fs/promises and node:child_process ([ffcc9c0](https://github.com/tux86/awssesh/commit/ffcc9c03f57059a9f146f3d0e999dde64e2c6fdf))

## [2.1.0](https://github.com/tux86/awssesh/compare/v2.0.0...v2.1.0) (2026-08-31)


### ⚠ Upgrade note

Credentials written by 2.0.0 are quoted in a way the AWS CLI cannot parse. Run
`awssesh refresh <profile>` (or let ⟳ auto-refresh run) once after upgrading to
rewrite `~/.aws/credentials` correctly.

### Bug Fixes

* **aws:** write credentials the AWS CLI can actually read. Session tokens end in base64 `==` padding, and the `ini` serialiser quoted any value containing `=`. The AWS parsers take everything after the first `=` verbatim, so the token reached AWS with literal `"` characters and every signed request failed to sign ([#18](https://github.com/tux86/awssesh/issues/18))
* **aws:** chmod `~/.aws/credentials` to 0600 on every write; live session credentials were left at the default umask ([#18](https://github.com/tux86/awssesh/issues/18))
* **aws:** only route the user to a browser login when the token is genuinely rejected — a network blip or a missing role grant used to report "needs login" ([#18](https://github.com/tux86/awssesh/issues/18))
* **cli:** keep the SSO device URL clickable when it wraps, via an OSC 8 hyperlink; a wrapped URL previously opened only its first fragment ([#18](https://github.com/tux86/awssesh/issues/18))
* **cli:** stop `c` / `o` handing out expired credentials while reporting success ([#18](https://github.com/tux86/awssesh/issues/18))
* **cli:** fix a hang when cancelling a login and immediately retrying the same profile ([#18](https://github.com/tux86/awssesh/issues/18))
* **cli:** stop the expiry countdown jumping to the SSO token's value after every refresh ([#18](https://github.com/tux86/awssesh/issues/18))
* **cli:** support Wayland, WSL and SSH clipboards (`wl-copy`, `xsel`, `clip.exe`, OSC 52); only `xclip` was tried before ([#18](https://github.com/tux86/awssesh/issues/18))
* **cli:** stop advertising a phantom update that downgrades, and add `AWSSESH_NO_UPDATE_CHECK` ([#18](https://github.com/tux86/awssesh/issues/18))
* **cli:** expire status messages, clamp `refreshLeadMinutes`, and surface login failure reasons ([#18](https://github.com/tux86/awssesh/issues/18))

### Features

* **cli:** redesign the dashboard and fix credential-file corruption ([#18](https://github.com/tux86/awssesh/issues/18)) ([e0dbfe0](https://github.com/tux86/awssesh/commit/e0dbfe02e6de497c38de652e1cb5657d92af0e9f))
* **cli:** responsive layout (46–104 columns) with a scrolling viewport, live-ticking countdowns, a `?` help overlay, `g`/`G` and PageUp/PageDown ([#18](https://github.com/tux86/awssesh/issues/18))
* **cli:** show role-credential and SSO-token expiry separately in the details view ([#18](https://github.com/tux86/awssesh/issues/18))

### Build System

* require Bun >= 1.4, update all dependencies, drop `@aws-sdk/client-sts` ([#18](https://github.com/tux86/awssesh/issues/18))

## [2.0.0](https://github.com/tux86/awssesh/compare/v1.4.0...v2.0.0) (2026-06-12)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* the npm package and CLI command are renamed from `ssomatic` to `awssesh`. Use `npx awssesh` (or reinstall with `npm i -g awssesh`); the `ssomatic` package is no longer published.

### Features

* rename project to awssesh ([986aea7](https://github.com/tux86/awssesh/commit/986aea73f7424e99ea5c60a4180c1fbca7fee9eb))
