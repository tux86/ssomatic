# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it responsibly.

**Do not open a public issue.** Instead, email the maintainers or use [GitHub's private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/tux86/ssomatic/security/advisories/new).

We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and aim to provide a fix within 7 days for critical issues.

## Scope

This policy applies to all packages:

- `@ssomatic/core`
- `@ssomatic/cli`
- `@ssomatic/web`

## Best Practices

- Never commit AWS credentials, tokens, or secrets
- Use AWS SSO for authentication (which is what SSOmatic facilitates)
- Keep dependencies up to date
