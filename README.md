## Why awssesh

- **k9s-style list-first dashboard** — all your SSO profiles at a glance with live expiry countdowns; navigate with j/k or arrow keys, no menus to dig through.
- **In-process auto-refresh for ⟳ pinned profiles** — pin a profile with `a` and expiry-aware refresh keeps its credentials ready before they expire, with no fixed-interval polling waste.
- **Notify-on-login, never surprise you** — when an interactive SSO login is required awssesh sends a desktop notification so you know to log in.
- **One-keystroke everything** — copy `export AWS_*` vars, open the AWS console, copy the profile name, or force a refresh — all from the dashboard without leaving your terminal.
- **Single process, clean exit** — quitting fully exits. No background processes to manage.

## Install

```bash
# Run without installing
npx awssesh@latest
bunx awssesh@latest

# Or install globally
npm install -g awssesh
```

> Use the `@latest` tag. `bunx` caches resolved packages in `~/.bun/install/cache`,
> so a bare `bunx awssesh` keeps running whatever version it cached first. If you
> are already stuck on an old one, `bun pm cache rm` clears it.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Launch the dashboard
awssesh

# 2. Navigate to a profile and press 'a' to pin it for auto-refresh
# 3. awssesh auto-refreshes pinned profiles while the dashboard is open
# 4. Press 'q' to quit when done
```

While the dashboard is open, ⟳ pinned profiles are refreshed automatically when their credentials are close to expiry. When a browser login is required, you get a desktop notification and can log in directly from the TUI or with `awssesh refresh <profile>`.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `awssesh` | Launch the interactive TUI |
| `awssesh status` | Print profile statuses and exit |
| `awssesh refresh [name]` | Refresh a profile (or all favorites) now |
| `awssesh export <name>` | Print `export AWS_*` lines for `eval $(...)` |
| `awssesh --version` | Print version and exit |
| `awssesh --help` | Show usage |

**Shell trick — inject credentials into your current shell:**

```bash
eval $(awssesh export prod)
```

## How Auto-Refresh Works

awssesh tracks the role-credential expiry for each ⟳ pinned profile and refreshes only when the credentials are within the lead window of expiring (default: 5 minutes before expiry). No fixed interval; no wasted refreshes.

When an interactive SSO login is needed, a desktop notification is sent (`awssesh: <profile> needs login`). You authorize by logging in from the TUI or with `awssesh refresh <profile>`.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| `AWSSESH_NO_UPDATE_CHECK` | Skip the GitHub release check on startup |
| `AWSSESH_NO_HYPERLINKS` | Render URLs as plain text instead of clickable OSC 8 links |

---

## Prerequisites

- [AWS CLI v2](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) configured with SSO profiles in `~/.aws/config`
- A clipboard tool for `c` / `y` (`pbcopy`, `wl-copy`, `xclip`, `xsel`, or `clip.exe`). Over SSH,
  awssesh falls back to OSC 52 so copies land in your *local* clipboard.

## Development

Requires [Bun](https://bun.sh) >= 1.4.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tux86/awssesh.git
cd awssesh
bun install

bun run start    # Run from source
bun run dev      # Run with --watch (auto-restart on changes)
bun run build    # Build the Node CLI bundle (dist/cli.js)
bun run lint     # Run ESLint
bun test         # Run unit tests
bun run typecheck  # Typecheck
```

> TypeScript is pinned to 6.x: `typescript-eslint` does not yet support the
> TypeScript 7 compiler API, so bumping it breaks `bun run lint` in CI.
